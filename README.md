# Miller_CO
Introduction

Millers & Co. is a fashion e-commerce platform that sells both male and female apparel goods from over 30 companies in various nations. You are the Business Intelligence Analyst, and the C-suite has asked a report on the performance of various brands and goods in order to better understand the present position and how to increase sales.

You met briefly with Faye, the Chief Data Officer, and decided on the questions to answer based on the brief provided by the C-executives. In addition, Larry has contacted the Lead Data Engineer to get the datasets you need from several tables that are appropriate for your report.

About the dataset
There are a total of four datasets for this project; product, sales, customers and coupon tables and you can access them all HERE.

Business Questions
Following your meeting with Faye, here are the business questions you both agreed to answer to include in the report.

Final Thoughts
To stay up with trends and competition, fashion merchants must establish business KPIs and continuously monitor and measure them to determine what is working and what is not. These KPIs might fall under other areas, such as sales and product analysis, as seen in this case study.
